# Image-Caption-Multilabel-Classification
In this assignment, I am required to solve the multi-label classification task. Each sample in this dataset includes:
  
（1）an image,

（2）one or more labels, range: 1-19 (12 is missing)
  
（3）a short caption that summarizes the image.
  
My goal is to implement an image classifier that predicts the labels of image data sample.

The specification is in Assignment2.pdf

The implementation deatils are included in the Code.ipynb/ Code_Another_Version file

Report is also uploaded for your reference.
